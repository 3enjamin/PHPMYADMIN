phpmyadmin_heroku
=================

This is my kludgy way of running phpMyAdmin on Heroku. All you need to do is
customize `config.inc.php` as you would normally to get things running.
Note: The `config.inc.php` is the sample file provided with phpMyAdmin.

Please register an issue or submit a PR if you think there's a better way of
doing this!
